From the Agile Manifesto, complete the following: 

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan



Scrum is a software product development framework that helps an organization (mostly software company) address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value to their customers. Scrum is a subset of Agile methodology.

Some of the benefit of Scrum in software development are;
Clear Team Roles
In a Scrum Team, everyone understands their role and what responsibilities this entails. This is an excellent safeguard – nothing gets missed.
It also creates a tightly-knit, high-performing team. Each member trusts that the others will carry out their roles and communicate if any assistance is required.
Flexibility
Scrum is a project management methodology designed to respond easily and positively to change. With conventional project management methods and management courses, changing requirements can be a nightmare to handle. Is the opposite with approaches like Scrum and its parent methodology, Agile. They are designed to be responsive at all stages in a project’s life cycle.

Transparency
Transparency is one of the 3 Pillars of Scrum, the foundational principles upon which the rest of Scrum is built. Different elements within a Scrum Sprint (project cycle) help to uphold this pillar. The Scrum Board displays ongoing tasks and their progress, the Daily Standup Meeting provides an opportunity to flag any obstacles, and the Sprint Planning and Review clearly outline the priorities and achievements of the Sprint respectively.
