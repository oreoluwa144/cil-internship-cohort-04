UI/UX Fundamentals 

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UI and UX


User experience (UX) refers to the user’s journey when interacting with a product or service. UX design is the process of creating products or services that provide meaningful experiences for users, involving many different areas of product development including branding, usability, function, and design. A UX designer’s primary goal is for each user to have a positive interaction with a product or service. Whether the interaction solves a problem, provides entertainment, or helps the user find critical information, the experience should leave the user feeling fulfilled. 

UI design, on the other hand, refers to the actual interfaces with which users engage. The UI design process may include buttons or widgets, text, images, sliders, and other interactive elements. UI designers ensure that every visual element, transition, and animation included within a product or service is setting the stage for a fluid, positive experience. 

The difference between UI and UX is UX design is all about the overall feel of the experience, while UI design is about how the product’s interfaces look and function. UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems, UI design is about creating intuitive, aesthetically pleasing. Interactive interfaces.

Problem solving using UX

Delivering a great UX solution is influenced by two key parameters: user research and creative problem-solving. There are steps in solving problems, they include : 

Identifying the problem; the first thing a UX designer does is think about the problemthen get to work solving it. Identifying the problem may include research and it will prove beneficial to the project in the long run.
CLARIFY THE UX PROBLEM:Now that the UX designer has identified the UX problem, it’s time to demystify it. In this step, user journey will be created. It does not have to be perfect; some low-fidelity sketches are more than enough.
USE ANALYTICS: UX design is also about numbers and data. This is why analytics are critical to UX problem-solving. Once the designer has gathered some data from users and competitors, it’s time to create patterns. This will help the designer better understand the problem and change your drafts accordingly.
FEEDBACK:As a UX designer, getting feedback from the users after testing is important in solving a UX problem, it helps to focus on the issue itself. 
SOLVE THE PROBLEM:The is the last step. Once the UX designer has listened to people’s feedback, they can redesign your original solution. Then they are just one step away from solving the UX problem. Now it’s time to digitally redesign your idea.

Good and Bad UX
In a good example of UX design, the users are informed about what is happening on the page in a reasonable response time following the action. Whereas, if the page doesn’t provide timely feedback as to what’s happening on the page, it may create a more negative or confusing experience and is a classic example of bad UX design. A good UX design uses words that users can easily understand, and take action on, whereas a bad UX design may use highly technical jargon that only experts may understand. Errors are inevitable, however, when it happens, a good UX design would inform users about it. However, you need to be careful of language, tone and design. Leaning on technical language, or database error terms will lead to a bad user experience.
UX careers
 Ux researcher :  UX researchers focus on all things research related. They conduct research with real users, gathering both qualitative and quantitative data about how people think, feel, and behave. They then share these insights with the entire product team, helping everyone understand the target audience and informing a user-centric design strategy. 
UX writer: UX writers create all of the corresponding copy. UX writers craft all the text that the user encounters when using a product or service, from the error message that pops up when you enter the wrong password. 
Information architect: When an information architect works on a new website, they consider the user’s journey across the site to determine how to organize the information on each page and how individual pages connect to create logical navigation. Their goal is to make it as easy as possible for the user to find what they’re looking for.
UI/UX designer:UX/UI designers cover both the user experience and the visual aspects of product design. They conduct user research, create low- or high-fidelity prototypes, carry out user testing, and take care of the interface design—everything from color schemes and typography right through to icon design, imagery, and interactive properties.
UX Strategist: UX strategists bring a user-centered mindset to the boardroom, while also making sure that the design team is working with the business goals in mind.
